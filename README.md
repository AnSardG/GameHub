# GameHub

GameHub uses IGDB.com API in order to display every video game possible! This app is being produced for educational purposes
and at first it will only be thought for mobile phone (it's not responsive at all, unless someone wants to contribute in that).

Since I've got little time to develop this app there aren't a lot of functionalities and backend code can get real messy 
sometimes :).
